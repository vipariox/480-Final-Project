## *Research Question, Background, and Problems*

Our research problem is to determine how residents in Long Island City, NY and Crystal City, VA feel about Amazon building a facility in their cities. 

Many cities advocated to win the bid for Amazon to build their facility in their city, citing economic advantages and increased employment opportunities. However, there has been some speculation about whether the residents of these areas are actually supportive of their local government’s decision to allow Amazon to build in their cities.
